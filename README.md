# DeepLearning-ConvNet
Deep Convolutional Neural Network implemented using CUDA and SFML

This project is my first atempt to implement a Deep Neural Network.

-==The Goal==-

-MAIN-
The program is that it should be able to classifi a set of 60000 images(of size 32x32x3 each) to one of 100 different classes.
Should utilze the GPU using CUDA.

-Bonus-
The program should still be generic enough to solve any kind of problem where deep learning can be applied.

-==Short Description==-

Image dataset included: CIFAR-10. Images are saved in .bin files, each file containing 10000 images and the class each image belong to. Description of the dataset ->(http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~kriz/cifar.html)

SFML is used to display the images.

Program language: C++ & CUDA
